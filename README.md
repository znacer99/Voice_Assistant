# Project Title

This Python script introduces a versatile Voice Assistant designed to carry out diverse tasks, from fetching Wikipedia data to web browsing. The cornerstone of this assistant lies in the SpeechRecognition API, empowering it to seamlessly convert spoken words into text, a crucial aspect of voice-controlled applications like Siri or Alexa.

Key Features and Modules:

Subprocess: Retrieves crucial system subprocess details for executing commands such as Shutdown or Sleep.

Wolframalpha: Harnesses advanced algorithms and AI technology from Wolfram to provide expert-level answers.

Pyttsx3: Facilitates offline text-to-speech conversion, enhancing the assistant's adaptability and user-friendliness.

Wikipedia: Leverages the Wikipedia module to retrieve valuable information from its extensive knowledge base.

Speech Recognition: An essential for voice recognition, enabling the assistant to accurately comprehend and respond to user queries.

Web Browser: Built-in web browser functionality for convenient web searches and information retrieval.

ES Capture: Captures images from the camera, adding a visual component to the assistant's capabilities.

Datetime: Displays real-time date and time information to keep users informed.

Twilio: Integrates Twilio for making calls and sending messages directly through the assistant.

Requests: Utilizes the Requests module for streamlined handling of GET and POST requests.

This Voice Assistant script seamlessly combines these modules, offering users a comprehensive and interactive solution to perform an array of tasks through intuitive voice commands.
